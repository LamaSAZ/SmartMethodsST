# Building circuit for operating brushless motor

## Abstract
We will use the brushless motor in the robot foot, and in the brushless we will simulate the circuit of the electric scooter

In the circuit, I used brushless motor with an electronic speed controller to control the speed of the motor through a potentiometer, and the Arduino will translate the potentiometer signal to be understood by the esc.
