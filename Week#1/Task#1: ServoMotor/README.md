# Simulation of a Servo Motor

## Abstract
We will use the servo motor to control the robot's hands.

In this task, it is only required to know how to control the servo motor through the Arduino.

I connected the servo to one of the PWN pins on the Arduino so that I could control its rotation angle through simple commands.
