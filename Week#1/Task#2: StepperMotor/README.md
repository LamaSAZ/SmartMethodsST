# Simulation of a Stepper Motor

## Abstarct
Stepper motors offer precision drive control for motion control applications due to their high pole count.

In the stepper motor circuit, I used an A4988 driver as an intermediary between the stepper and the Arduino to control the steps or degree of its rotation as well as the direction of rotation.
