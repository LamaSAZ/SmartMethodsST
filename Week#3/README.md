# Simulation Circuit With Sensors Using Arduino

## Abstract

The aim of this task is to design a circuit using arduino with analog and digital sensors.

Sensors used:
- Analog Sensor = Temperature Sensor (TMP 36).
- Digital Sensor = RIP Sensor

The idea of the circuit is that the led will turn on if and only if the RIP sensor detect motion and the temp rise to 50 CÙ’
