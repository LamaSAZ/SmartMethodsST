# Simulation simple On Off System using Arduino

## Abstarct 
In this project I made a simple on/off system, using Arduino and LED controlled by a push button.

The reason to use the push button instead of the normal switch button is that it is one button provides variety uses.
The nature of the push button is momentary (where the switch function only continues for as long as the operator is pushing the button). to keep it maintained (where the switch function stays latched in that status after it has been actuated) we will going to do a simple trick, by saving the old status of push button to change the LED status only when the button is pressed.
